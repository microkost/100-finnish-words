Idea that 100 most frequent/usable words in any language is based in pop-culture. Academic research wasn't done but it comes from personal observation of trying to learn Finnish as non-native speaker.
Feature of this app **is having active tile** in Windows 10 start menu **with word and translations** on eyes **with every open of start** menu.
You can learn any 100 words from supported language if you understand at least one of supported language - language order should be changed in settings.
